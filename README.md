## Overview

**ZrMaps-statistical-analysis** is an open-source toolkit designed for the **statistical analysis, classification, and anomaly detection of chemical element maps** acquired using X-ray scanning techniques (e.g., micro-XRF, EPMA/WDS, SEM–EDS mapping, laboratory μXRF scanners, synchrotron XRF, etc.).

The project provides a set of **robust, reproducible, and scalable tools** to identify mineral phases—**especially zircon (ZrSiO₄)**—in large-area elemental maps (e.g., 10×10 cm thin sections scanned at 30–50 µm pixel size).  
The framework integrates both **classical univariate anomaly detection** (IQR, MAD, Z-score, adaptive percentile thresholds, local MAD) and **density-based clustering algorithms** (DBSCAN and HDBSCAN), offering complementary perspectives on Zr enrichment patterns.

Together, these methods deliver **fast and reliable identification of zircon grains** in complex geological matrices where traditional petrography is insufficient or too time-consuming.

## Scientific Motivation

Zircon is a cornerstone mineral in modern **geochronology**, **petrogenesis**, and **crustal evolution studies**.  
However, locating zircon grains in **large thin sections** or **drill-core slabs** mapped by micro-XRF or EPMA can be challenging due to:

- very low Zr concentrations in most rock-forming minerals,  
- strong signal variability related to acquisition parameters (integration time, beam intensity, matrix attenuation),  
- sub-pixel mixing effects when using coarse pixel sizes (30–50 μm), and  
- overlapping fluorescence lines (e.g., Zr-Kα with P-Kα or Si-Kα under specific detector geometries).

This toolkit provides **automated, statistically robust detection workflows** that minimise these limitations and allow high-confidence pre-screening of zircon occurrences prior to targeted analyses such as:

- EPMA/WDS  
- LA-ICP-MS  
- SHRIMP  
- TEM  
- atom-probe tomography

## Implemented Methods

### **1. Classical statistical anomaly detection**
Included in `zircon_zr_alltests_FULL.py`:
- **IQR (Interquartile Range) thresholds**  
- **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) – global**  
- **Z-score (μ ± nσ)**  
- **Adaptive percentiles** (P85–P95–P99.5)  
- **Local MAD** (moving-window anomaly detection)  
- **GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models)** for probabilistic separation

Each method generates:
- linear and log-scale anomaly maps,  
- histograms with threshold lines,  
- combined multi-method panels,  
- TSV matrices, CSV summaries, and  
- a multi-page PDF report.

### **2. Density-based clustering**
Included in `zircon_zr_DBSCAN_HDBSCAN.py`:
- **DBSCAN** and **HDBSCAN** clustering on Zr intensity  
- automatic extraction of high-density anomaly cores  
- zircon-likeness classification (0–4 scale, consistent with statistical tests)  
- progress bars and TSV cluster matrices  
- optional PDF export

These methods are particularly good at detecting:
- isolated zircon grains,  
- small zircon clusters within biotite or amphibole,  
- zoning patterns within large Zr-rich grains.

### **3. Multi-element phase classification (FRAC)**
`frac_classification_auto.py` computes FRAC ratios (FRAC_Si … FRAC_Zr) from multi-element maps and applies **KMeans clustering (k=15)** to generate phase maps useful for:

- contextualising zircon within host minerals  
- estimating local chemical composition  
- guiding micro-sampling or microanalytical work
